Parameter			: parameter number
Instance			: instance number
Model				: abbrevation of the used model
H_M_Makespan		: the computed makespan of the model if at least one heuristic start solution is used
noH_Makespan		: the computed makespan of the model if no heuristic start solution is used
H_UB				: upper bound if at least one heuristic start solution is used
H_LB				: lower bound if at least one heuristic start solution is used
Optimal-Makespan	: the optimal makespan of the problem-instance from the official solution file
H_Time				: the time it took the model to compute the problem instance if at least one heuristic start solution is used
noH_Time			: the time it took the model to compute the problem instance if no heuristic start solution is used
Time_Diff			: the time diffrence it took the model to compute with or without the use of a heuristic start solution (H-Time - noH-Time)
H_Makespan			: the makespan of the heuristic start solution, if one is used
time_limit_reached	: if the solver was stopped cause the given time limit to solve the problem instance is reached
Error				: if the optimal makespan is not within the computed bounds by either the use of the model with or without the use of a heuristic start solution
Heuristics			: a list of the abbrevations of the used heuristic start solutions

Total time the models with the heuristic start solution were able to compute the problem instances faster than the models without the heuristic start solution: 
count every instance: 
average time difference: 
count only the instances where the time limit was not reached: 
average time difference:
